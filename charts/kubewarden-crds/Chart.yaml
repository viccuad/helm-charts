# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 1.1.0

annotations:
  # required ones:
  catalog.cattle.io/certified: rancher # Any application we are adding as a helm chart
  catalog.cattle.io/experimental: true # Any application that is experimental
  catalog.cattle.io/namespace: cattle-kubewarden-system # Must prefix with cattle- and suffix with -system
  catalog.cattle.io/release-name: rancher-kubewarden-crds # If this is an upstream app, prefixing with rancher is the preferred naming choice.
  catalog.cattle.io/os: linux   # this means linux only, other choice here is "windows". For charts that support both, don't add this annotation

  # optional ones:
  catalog.cattle.io/provides-gvr: policyservers.policies.kubewarden.io/v1  # Declare that this chart provides a type, which other charts may use in `requires-gvr`. Only add to parent, not CRD chart.
  catalog.cattle.io/hidden: true  # Hide specific charts. Only use on CRD charts.
